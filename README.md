# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This repo is to practice and document the principles of Requirement Analysis in the software development lifecycle.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders share a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements).

Its importance lies in the fact that it creates the foundation for the entire project. Well-defined requirements help prevent miscommunication, reduce costly rework, and ensure that the final product aligns with business goals and user needs. By clarifying the project scope, requirement analysis guides the design, coding, and testing phases, while also providing measurable acceptance criteria for validation.

In short, without proper requirement analysis, projects risk scope creep, missed objectives, and wasted resources. With it, teams gain clarity, efficiency, and a structured path to successful software delivery.
