# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This repo is to practice and document the principles of Requirement Analysis in the software development lifecycle.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders share a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements).

Its importance lies in the fact that it creates the foundation for the entire project. Well-defined requirements help prevent miscommunication, reduce costly rework, and ensure that the final product aligns with business goals and user needs. By clarifying the project scope, requirement analysis guides the design, coding, and testing phases, while also providing measurable acceptance criteria for validation.

In short, without proper requirement analysis, projects risk scope creep, missed objectives, and wasted resources. With it, teams gain clarity, efficiency, and a structured path to successful software delivery.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
- Clarity and Understanding:
Requirement analysis ensures that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the software should do. This reduces ambiguity, prevents misunderstandings, and aligns the project team with user expectations.

- Scope Definition:
Clearly defining functional and non-functional requirements sets the boundaries of the project. This prevents scope creep and keeps the development process focused on agreed objectives.

- Foundation for Design, Development, and Quality Assurance:
Requirements act as the blueprint for system design and development, while also serving as benchmarks for testing and validation. This structured foundation helps in estimating cost and time accurately, and ensures the final product meets quality standards and customer needs.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
1. Requirement Gathering

This is the first step, where the project team collects information about the system from stakeholders such as clients, users, and subject matter experts. The goal is to understand the business needs and expectations.

Example: Interviewing hotel managers and customers to understand what features are essential in a booking management system (e.g., room search, booking, cancellation).

2. Requirement Elicitation

Elicitation goes beyond gathering — it focuses on uncovering hidden needs, clarifying vague requirements, and resolving conflicts between stakeholders. It ensures the real needs are captured, not just the stated ones.

Example: Running a workshop with hotel staff to identify pain points in the current booking process, such as difficulties in updating room availability in real-time.

3. Requirement Documentation

Once requirements are gathered and refined, they are documented in a structured way so they can serve as a reference throughout the SDLC. Documentation can take the form of Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, or use cases.

Example: Creating a requirement specification that states, “The system shall allow users to cancel bookings up to 24 hours before check-in and issue an automatic refund.”

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling

In this step, the requirements are examined for feasibility, consistency, completeness, and priority. The team may also model the requirements using visual tools like UML diagrams, flowcharts, or entity-relationship diagrams to better understand system interactions.

Example: Creating a use-case diagram that shows how different actors (customers, admins, staff) interact with the booking system.

5. Requirement Validation

Validation ensures that the documented requirements truly reflect stakeholder needs and align with business goals. This step involves reviews, walkthroughs, and stakeholder sign-off to confirm accuracy, clarity, and testability of requirements.

Example: Reviewing the requirement list with hotel management to confirm that the system supports seasonal pricing and discount codes before development begins.
